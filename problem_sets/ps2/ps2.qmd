## Q1: Counting NA values
For each column, how many rows are NA? Write a function that returns a two-column DataFrame where each row is a variable, the first column of the DataFrame is the name of each variable, and the second column of the DataFrame is the number of times that the column is NA. 

### Importing the dataset
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import jupyter
import pandas as pd

# File path for the parking tickets dataset
file_path = '/Users/doudouliu/Desktop/python 2/student30538/problem_sets/ps2/data/parking_tickets_one_percent.csv'

# Reading the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display first few rows to ensure the dataset is loaded correctly
print(df.head())
```

#Q1a, How many NAs
```{python}
# Function to count NAs for each column
Nna = df.isna().sum()
print(Nna)
```
